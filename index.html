      <p>My name is Geoff Lloyd, I'm a musician and audio engineer turned software developer. I've lived around Seattle my whole life, attending Edmonds Community College out of high school to study vocal jazz and digital music, onward to Central Washington University to study Music Education, then worked around the area selling musical instruments, building harps, working at a music venue, and mixing shows in various settings.</p>
      <p>Here's a breakdown of my past experience:</p>
      <p>School:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Edmonds Community College (Now Edmonds College)</li>
        <li>Central Washington University</li>
        <li>University of Washington</li>
        <li>Code Fellows</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kennelly Keys Music</li>
        <li>Dusty Strings</li>
        <li>Edmonds Center for the Arts</li>
        <li>Third Place Commons</li>
        <li>DeMiero Jazz Festival</li>
        <li>Northwest Center/NOAA</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In my spare time, I live with my cat Milo, who is a cute floof ball of chaos and anarchy. I'm also currently a Dungeon Master for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign with some friends, but I've homebrewed the setting and the story. I'm an avid appreciator of the color purple and brandish its likeness often.</p>
      <p>My goal with learning software development is to lean into the skills I left behind when I opted to focus on humanities at an academic level. I went back to school a few years ago to pursue an interdisciplinary humanities degree at the University of Washington, but something felt like it was missing from the direction I was taking and I decided to experiment with an intro to java course. I've always been good with numbers and logic, and coding revitalized that passion for the creative problem solving that coding can present sometimes.</p>
      <p>Because the Covid-19 pandemic made doing anything with music difficult professionally, I decided that perhaps I should finally commit to broadening my skills and embracing things I was good at before, before my path diverged.</p>
